## 🎯 Research Question

> How can degradation-aware MPC coordinate PV, BESS, EV charging, heat-pump flexibility, and grid-supportive operation to reduce operating cost, emissions, peak grid import, voltage violations, feeder congestion, and battery aging in a German renewable district microgrid?

## 🧠 What Is MPC?

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)** is an optimization-based control strategy that looks ahead into the future and decides the best control action now.

In this project, the MPC forecasts:

* future solar generation,
* load demand,
* EV availability,
* battery state of charge,
* electricity price,
* carbon intensity,
* feeder constraints,
* voltage limits.

Then it decides:

* when to charge or discharge the battery,
* when to charge EVs,
* when to use heat-pump flexibility,
* when to import/export electricity,
* when to reduce peak demand,
* how to protect battery health.

## 🧮 MPC Objective Function

The optimization minimizes a combined cost function:

```text
Total Cost =
Grid Import Cost
- Export Revenue
+ Carbon Cost
+ Battery Degradation Cost
+ Load Shedding Penalty
+ Heat Shortfall Penalty
+ EV Mobility Shortfall Penalty
+ Renewable Curtailment Penalty
```

The controller balances economics, sustainability, battery health, and grid reliability.

## 🔬 Validation Layers

### 1️⃣ Linearized Feeder Validation

A fast approximate feeder model checks:

* minimum voltage,
* maximum voltage,
* line loading,
* transformer loading,
* feeder congestion.

### 2️⃣ pandapower AC Validation

A balanced AC power-flow model validates:

* LV bus voltages,
* transformer loading,
* line loading,
* grid import/export feasibility.

### 3️⃣ OpenDSS Unbalanced Validation

Optional OpenDSS validation checks:

* unbalanced three-phase operation,
* phase-specific load distribution,
* distributed PV injection,
* feeder voltage behavior.

---

## 🔋 Battery Degradation Analysis

Battery aging is estimated using:

* energy throughput,
* equivalent full cycles,
* rainflow cycle counting,
* depth-of-discharge behavior,
* temperature correction,
* state-of-health estimation,
* degradation cost approximation.

This makes the controller more realistic than a simple battery dispatch model.
